\subsection{Detailed Description}
These functions generate the xx\+Hash of an input provided in multiple segments, as opposed to provided as a single block.

X\+X\+H state must first be allocated, using either static or dynamic method provided above.

Start a new hash by initializing state with a seed, using X\+X\+Hnn\+\_\+reset().

Then, feed the hash state by calling X\+X\+Hnn\+\_\+update() as many times as necessary. Obviously, input must be valid, hence allocated and read accessible. The function returns an error code, with 0 meaning O\+K, and any other value meaning there is an error.

Finally, a hash value can be produced anytime, by using X\+X\+Hnn\+\_\+digest(). This function returns the nn-\/bits hash as an int or long long.

It\textquotesingle{}s still possible to continue inserting input into the hash state after a digest, and later on generate some new hashes, by calling again X\+X\+Hnn\+\_\+digest().

When done, free X\+X\+H state space if it was allocated dynamically.
